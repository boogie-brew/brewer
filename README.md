Recipe for basic compost tea
```
Many recipes exist for making compost tea. This is intended as a starting point only and does not
guarantee results. There are currently no USDA standards about what makes “good” compost tea.
Experiment and observe to see if compost tea works in your garden.

Compost:
Healthy active compost such as vermicompost (worm compost.) Use 2 cups per 5 gallons of water.
Fungal food source: Liquid or powdered kelp, 2 tablespoons per 5 gallons
Bacterial food source: Sweet, unsulphered molasses, 2 tablespoons per 5 gallons

Add the liquid kelp and molasses to the water. Place powdered kelp in the strainer/mesh bag with the
compost.

Suspend the bag from the PVC tubing across the top of the brewer. Insert the short PVC pipe into the
bag to aerate the compost during the brew cycle.

The making and use of compost tea has not been scientifically tested and verified for use by Oregon
State University. This is an emerging area of interest in both commercial and home horticulture. For
